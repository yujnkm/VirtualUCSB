# VirtualUCSB

Send an email to yujnkm@engineering.ucsb.edu if you are interested in helping to complete the creation of the UCSB digital twin by adding a part of the 3D model of the campus.

We will have a complete 3D model of the UC Santa Barbara campus in no time with the help of muVRr members and contributors!

We are currently using Unity 2022.2.0b10

To help build virtual UCSB, create a fork of the project by following this guide: 
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects

Create a Unity project, delete the Assets folder, and git pull the provided Assets folder. Doing it this way doesn't require
any additional set-up with your git remote and it will work out of the box with Unity.

As a first step, create an empty scene with the building you plan to work on in the Scenes->Subsections directory. 
Edit this ReadMe file (the one you're currently reading) with a little information on the building/space (enough 
to clearly explain what area you are working on), and importantly, YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION (email).
Commit the scene, push to github, and open a pull request (guide linked above).

This insures any building currently being worked on will already be listed in the subsections folder. If someone wants
to work on an already in-progress building, they'll be able to reach out to the contact info listed in the ReadMe. 

In general, you should only be committing the scene that you are working on. You can (and should) make a
duplicate of the entire UCSB model in 'Environment->vrtucsb.fbx' to make sure your building is the correct size/shape.
