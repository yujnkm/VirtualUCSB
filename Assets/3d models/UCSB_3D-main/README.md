The project includes 3D models of three locations at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Each physical environment was scanned using LiDAR and post-processed to run in Unity game engine software. 

1) Kirby Crossing [Google Map (34.41471, -119.84060)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/34%C2%B024'53.0%22N+119%C2%B050'26.2%22W)

2) Student Affairs [Google Map (34.41630,-119.84730)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/34%C2%B024'58.7%22N+119%C2%B050'50.3%22W)

3) Life Science [Google Map (34.41207,-119.84425)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/34%C2%B024'43.5%22N+119%C2%B050'37.9%22W)

All 3D models are optimized as Unity environments and run well on any target device.



# Getting Started
Follow these instructions to install the necessary software. These instructions have been tested on the Unity 2020.3.10f1 LTS but the project scenes should have no problem opening from different versions of Unity as the environment is stripdown to the model itself. 

* [Unity 2020.3.10f1 LTS](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.10)


Once installed, clone this repo and open the project in Unity or Unity Hub.

The main scene can be found under UCSB_3D > Assets > Scenes.

## Exporting Packages
All three models can be found under (UCSB_3D > Assets > Scenes) the Scenes folder. Each Unity scene contains each model. You can proceed to gererate standalone Unity package by  right clicking the scene from the Unity editor’s menus and select ***Export Package...***
